# HANA ML dbplyr R Package

## Description
To work on a database like SAP HANA you usually work with the Structured Query Language (SQL) which is over 40 years old. But as a huge R fan I want to stay in my used environment and not switch back and forth. For example, after the first modeling phase in an ML use case I may have to go back into the data preparation phase to engineer new features. Hence, I want to be more flexible but still use the power of SAP HANA. The R package dbplyr brings both worlds together and is designed to work with database tables as if they were local data frames in R.

## Requirements
In order to "run" the provided sample codes, a SAP HANA database environment is required with the AFL-component installed, which includes the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL). Specific sample files will specify additional requirements if required.

## Download and Installation
The sample files can be downloaded and used within the respective user / developer environment, e.g. R files may be opened and used within RStudio. The sample files don't require a install step for themselves, they are simply downloaded and then opened in the respective editor.
